                                            I was thrilled in the summer of my sixth-grade year when I received the news that I had passed the only gifted secondary school in Ho Chi Minh City, imagining that I would study in a dynamic, open, and promising environment. However, once I became a student at the school, I discovered that the environment was sometimes still very passive and that there was always a hidden stereotype from the previous educational system. And, as someone who is always looking to try new things, to push the boundaries of my current self in order to become a better version of myself, the current education system in Vietnam leaves me wondering: "Is the best version of myself enlightened?" That is also why I am always interested in applying for scholarships and cultural exchange programs in different countries so that I can broaden my perspectives and improve myself in order to eventually accomplish my ultimate goal of bringing those good things back to Vietnam and making it a better place for the next generation.

                                        Another female classmate and I decided to enter a Science Research competition at school in March 2022 with the goal of developing a compact, inexpensive, and user-friendly reading device for the blind called “Lumos”. The device in particular will be integrated with letter recognition technology and converted into voice, allowing the blind to read any book or text they desire. Regrettably, due to the size of the competition at school, I have yet to implement that idea. However, ever since the competition ended, I've always hoped that the product one day would reach blind visually impaired people so they could live better lives. And that gradually became my motivation every day to continue learning programming and expanding my knowledge in the hope of one day creating a device that would make the lives of others around me easier.

                                            The first time I heard of MUN or debate was during the summer of 7th grade, and it was also the first time I learned how to express myself professionally and critically. Besides that, there are times when I read the essay topics on the application form and found myself completely taken aback by topics that I have never heard of in my life. Or, the first time I competed in a debate, I was astounded by how much my opinion changed after the rebuttal round. In other words, participating in MUN and debates has significantly broadened my prospects and expanded my mindset. In other words, participating in MUN and debates has significantly broadened my prospects and expanded my mindset. Most importantly, through MUN and debate events, I discovered the issue that I want to fight for, which is human rights and the environment. I intend to participate in MUNs and debate events again after more than a half-year absence, as well as apply to be the organizer of some MUNs or debate projects, once everything settles down.

                                        There have been numerous occasions when I found myself feeling disappointed and disenchanted by the surprised responses of many people when they learn of my desire to become a programmer in the future. They think it's strange simply because I'm a female, and the reality in Vietnam clearly demonstrates this: the number of women working as programmers in companies can be counted on one hand. I'm sad because the reality could have been different because I've always been taught that "nothing is impossible," and I'm also aware that a woman can do whatever she wants as long as she wishes and works hard enough. Such experiences have instilled in me the desire to open programming classes or projects in the future in order to spread programming knowledge to girls my age, in the hopes that one day no one else will be surprised to hear the phrase "female programmer."

                                            Technology, in my opinion, has been and will continue to be a potential tool for humans to solve problems we never thought we could. However, I believe that there are still a limited number of excellent programmers willing to step outside of their comfort zone in order to create a one-of-a-kind initiative. On the contrary, many people, despite having extremely useful ideas, do not know how to make them a reality. Therefore,  I'm also taking steps to improve my knowledge of computers and programming so that one day I can turn seemingly impossible ideas into useful objects and become indispensable in life, as well as becoming a programming "interpreter", who would turn people's primitive ideas into truly useful devices.

                                        Around the end of 2021, I had the opportunity to participate in a program called "Teaching English Voluntarily" for primary school children in remote areas of Vietnam. At the time, I was given the task of teaching a fourth-grade class in Nam Dinh. Although I knew that the "students" I was about to teach would have a poor English background due to Nam Dinh province's still primitive learning conditions, I felt frustrated for a few moments when comparing my situation to theirs. While I was sent to an English center at a young age, they could only count on these free programs to learn the language. After a few months, I had to quit teaching due to personal reasons, and the program ended a few months later. Yet,  I still hope to be able to participate in the program again in the future to continue sharing my knowledge, or one day I will be able to organize my own similar non-profit program with some friends to help Vietnamese children have a better education and a better future.
